        <h1>My Journey Programming: </h1>

        <h2>The time I fell in love: </h2>
        <p>
            I had never used a computer in my life until the pandemic came, when I was in the urgent need to  learn how to use one. <br>
            I quickly learnt the basic functionality, and I discovered that they could be very fun, and I got interested in how they work. <br>
            I decided to learn a Programming Language by my own, because my school didn't have  an informatics curriculum. <br>
            Since that moment, I have been fascinated by them, and always keen to learn more about them. <br>
            That is the reason why I am going to study Computer Science in a University. 
        </p>

        <h2>Programming Languages: </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Python: 
            </li>
            <p>
                I have got a deep Python understanding, and have taken multiple courses on it. I am currently taking <br>
                the free online Harvard Course CS50 AI with Python. I am very familiar with the syntax, to the point <br>
                that I would be confortable coding without any assistance from Google. 
            </p>
            <li>
                C#: 
            </li>
            <p>
                I learnt this programming language in my Informatics class. My understanding is not that deep, and I have to look <br>
                up a lot of syntax while Coding, I have not got any Personal Projects in C#. 
            </p>
            <li>
                Wolfram Mathematica: 
            </li>
            <p>
                I also learnt this language in my Informatics class. I am confortable writing easy scripts, but do not have <br>
                a deep understanding of the language. 
            </p>
            <li>
                HTML & CSS: 
            </li>
            <p>
                Website Design and functionality, this Website is purely coded in HTML & CSS without <br>
                help of any other software. 
            </p>
            <li>
                Arduino - Raspberry Pi: 
            </li>
            <p>
                Learnt because of my Rubik's cube solver project.

            <li>
                Blender:
            </li>
            <p>
                Basic Modeling for my 3D-Printing projects. Learnt for my Rubik's cube solver project and the structure <br>
                supporting the motors. 
            </p>
            <li>
                SQL: 
            </li>
            <p>
                Basic MySQL knowledge, creating and editing tables. Learnt to understand DBMS.
