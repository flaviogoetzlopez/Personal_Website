            <h3>The time I fell in love: </h3>
            <p>
            
            Prior to the pandemic, I had never used a computer in my life. 
            But when circumstances demanded it, I quickly learned the basics and discovered 
            that computers could be both functional and fun.
            This newfound interest led me to explore the workings of computers and inspired me to learn 
            programming languages on my own, as my school didn't offer an informatics curriculum at that time.
            Since then, my fascination with computers has only grown. I've watched countless tutorials online 
            and have undertaken numerous personal projects.
            This passion has led me to decide to study Computer Science at a University.

            <h4>&#8226; Rubik's Cube solver: </h4><!--Do I want to show video working programm? --> 
            <p>
                I took on a project to develop a program that uses a camera input to interpret the structure 
                of a Rubik's cube and provide a clear sequence of steps to solve it. 
                
                The project comprises two programs: 
                <a href="assets/files/cube_image.py">cube_image.py</a>
                handles image processing, while 
                <a href="assets/files/rubix_cube_loesen.py">rubix_cube_loesen.py</a> 
                generates the necessary steps to solve the cube and displays the output visually.

            <p>                                 
            I created a program called <a href="assets/files/mathe_binominalverteilung.py">mathe_binominalverteilung.py</a> that calculates the binomial distribution, for my Math class.

                During the period of online classes, I developed 
                <a href="assets/files/get_into_class.py">get_into_class.py</a>.
                Its purpose was to automatically join me into my daily video conferences, enabling me to save time and avoid missing any of my classes.

                I developed a basic Tetris game using Python.

                Games Talente, a German organization, hosts a competition in which participants can submit their video games. 
                I submited my video game <a href="assets/files/Games_Talente_Projekt.py">Games_Talente_Projekt.py</a>, 
                and it was selected as a winner. As a result, I was able to participate in an amazing week-long workshop, 
                during which I learned a lot.

            <p>
                I have a strong grasp of Python, having completed multiple courses and currently 
                enrolled in the free Harvard CS50 AI with Python course. 
                I am highly proficient in the language's syntax and can confidently code without external help.
                 Additionally, I have completed several personal projects.

            <h3 >C++: </h3>
            <p>
                C++ is my preferred programming language because of its ability to provide complete hardware control, 
                which enhances my understanding of both programming and computers. I learnt C++ during 
                my computer science internship in Cottbus.
