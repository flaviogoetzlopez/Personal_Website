            <p>
                I had never used a computer in my life until the pandemic came, when I was in the urgent need to  learn how to use one.
                I quickly learnt the basic functionality, and I discovered that they could be very fun, and I got interested in how they work.
                I decided to learn a Programming Language by my own, because my school didn't have  an informatics curriculum.
                Since that moment, I have been fascinated by them, and always keen to learn more about them.
                That is the reason why I am going to study Computer Science in a University.

                <p>
                    I have got a deep Python understanding, and have taken multiple courses on it. I am currently taking
                    the free online Harvard Course CS50 AI with Python. I am very familiar with the syntax, to the point
                    that I would be confortable coding without any assistance from Google.

                <p>
                    I learnt this programming language in my Informatics class. My understanding is not that deep, and I have to look
                    up a lot of syntax while Coding, I have not got any Personal Projects in C#.

                    I also learnt this language in my Informatics class. I am confortable writing easy scripts, but do not have
                    a deep understanding of the language.

                I have been working the last 6 Months on my Project to completely build a machine from 
                scratch wich solves a Rubik's cube. I have written the entire code independantly.
